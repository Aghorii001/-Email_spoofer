# -Email_spoofer
PHP email spoofer. Send emails from any email adress.

Note: Make sure that you upload it to a PHP and email compatible server. You can use 000webhost as it's free.
Using the command line

You can use curl to send the PHP form from the command line:

curl --data "from=$FROM&to=TO&subject=SUBJECT&message=MESSAGE" $PHP_URL

If you want to do this automatically, you can use this little script.
